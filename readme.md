# CS2323 Lab-6: Cache Miss Simulator
Submission by Edward Nathan Varghese - CS22BTECH11020

-> The source code is **cache.cpp**.

-> Compile it with **g++ cache.cpp** and run it with **./a.out**

-> The input has to be given in **cache.config** and **cache.access** in the exact same format mentioned in the assignment document, and output is generated in **output.txt**.

> Note: Required header files are **iostream**, **fstream**, **vector**, **map**, **string**, **sstream** and **iomanip**. Input is expected to be correct and the code may produce erroneous results if input format is not followed correctly.

-> Some testcases have been included in **testcases.txt** along with their expected outputs.

-> Report of the assignment has also been written.
